# Digital Chuckram

A blockchain-based digital currency and voting platform for India, built with TypeScript and modern web technologies.

## Overview

Digital Chuckram is an experimental blockchain platform that combines digital currency with democratic voting mechanisms. The project aims to create a transparent, secure, and scalable system that could potentially serve as a national digital infrastructure.

The currency is named after the historical Chuckram, an ancient Indian currency, bringing together traditional heritage with modern blockchain technology.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **This project is in early development** ðŸš§

### Completed Components

- âœ… Core blockchain implementation
- âœ… Cryptographic utilities
- âœ… Consensus mechanism (Hybrid PoA + DPoS)
- âœ… P2P networking layer
- âœ… Basic type definitions

### In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Transaction builder
- ðŸ”„ Currency denomination system
- ðŸ”„ Smart contracts for voting

### Planned

- ðŸ“‹ Identity service with Aadhaar integration
- ðŸ“‹ API Gateway
- ðŸ“‹ Web and mobile interfaces
- ðŸ“‹ Admin dashboard

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Build System**: Nx Monorepo
- **Backend Framework**: NestJS (planned)
- **Frontend**: React (planned)
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Database**: LevelDB (current), PostgreSQL (planned)

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with the following structure:
```
